WARNING!!

PgRls required that ActiveRecord format migration as SQL 

Once you remove a tenant all of his data would be removed as well

PgRls::SecureConnection was included to your ApplicationRecord do not remove it

If you're setting a custom user, make sure to regenerate the structure.sql since
Postgresql policies are created on each user

===============================================================================

to generate secure model run

rails g pg_rls model_name

or

rails generate pg_rls model_name
