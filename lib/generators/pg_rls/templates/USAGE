ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! The PgRls gem has been successfully installed.

To generate a model with secure Row-Level Security (RLS), run the following command:

   rails g pg_rls ModelName

or

   rails generate pg_rls ModelName

ðŸ“Œ Remember:

- Replace `ModelName` with the actual name of your model (e.g., `User`, `Post`).
- This will set up the necessary RLS policies and table configurations for multi-tenant support.

ðŸ›   Next Steps:

1. After generating the model, review the generated migration and model files.
2. Ensure your database is configured to support Row-Level Security.
3. Run `rails db:migrate` to apply the generated migration.
4. Customize the generated policies to fit your application's security needs.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Check the documentation at <https://github.com/Dandush03/pg_rls>
   for more details on how to fine-tune RLS policies.
